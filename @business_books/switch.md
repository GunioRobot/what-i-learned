### Quick Review

Lots of interesting anecdotes. The charts in the back of the book could be useful as reminders. I don't think this is a world-changer, but might be a good skim when looking to make some big changes.

### Notes

"Play doesn’t have a script, it broadens the kind of things we consider doing. We become willing to fool around, to explore or invent new activities." [[122](http://books.google.com/books?id=QgzBqhbdlvUC&lpg=PA122&ots=fxmpBoOG4X&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false)]

(As a programmer, "play" means trying new languages, building quick side projects, learning from someone with a different perspective, tackling an unfamiliar problem, or even writing some code that I plan to throw away.)

Here’s a passage about giving customers a head start and leading them to, essentially, higher conversion rates. "One way to motivate action is to make people feel as though they’re already closer to the finish line than they might have thought." [[126](http://books.google.com/books?id=QgzBqhbdlvUC&lpg=PA126&ots=fxmpBoOM1X&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q&f=false)]

Action triggers are basically instant habits. An action trigger is basically noting when and where you are going to do something (I'm going to exercise tomorrow morning at 8am). Research shows that action triggers lead to a much higher rate of forming habits. [209]

Leaders who can install habits that reinforce their teams' goals are essentially making progress for free. Any leader can install a habit. The key is the habit should serve the mission. [215]

#### The One Page Overview

_For things to change, somebody somewhere has to start acting differently. Maybe it's you, maybe it's your team. Picture that person (or people)._

_Each has an emotional Elephant side and a rational Rider side. You've got to reach both. And you've also got to clear the way for them to succeed. In short, you must do three things._

**DIRECT the Rider**
* FOLLOW THE BRIGHT SPOTS. Investigate what's working and clone it. [solutios-focused therapy]
* SCRIPT THE CRITICAL MOVES. Don't think big picture, think in terms of specific behaviors. [1% milk]
* POINT TO THE DESTINATION. Change is easier when you know where you're going and why it's worth it. ["You'll be third graders soon"]

**MOTIVATE the Elephant**
* FIND THE FEELING. Knowing something isn't enough to cause change. Make people feel something. [Piling gloves on the table]
* SHRINK THE CHANGE. Break down the change until it no longer spooks the Elephant. [The 5-Minute Room Rescue]
* GROW YOUR PEOPLE. Cultivate a sense of identity and instill growth mindset. [Brasilata's "inventors"]

**SHAPE the Path**
* TWEAK THE ENVIRONMENT. When the situation changes, the behavior changes. So change the situation. [Throwing out the phone system at Rackspace]
* BUILD HABITS. When behavior is habitual, it's "free" - it doesn't tax the Rider. Look for ways to encourage habits. [Setting "action triggers," eating two bowls of soup while dieting, using checklists]
* RALLY THE HERD. Behavior is contagious. Help it spread. ["Fataki" in Tanzania, seeding the tip jar]
