The Power of Less

### Quick Review

This book reads like a book written by a blog author using a lot of his existing blog content to fill the pages. You know the drill. Odd repetition of ideas across chapters is a sure sign. At least he didn't outright contradict himself like [some books I know](http://www.amazon.com/Poke-Box-Seth-Godin/dp/1936719002). Anyway, it was to be expected since Babauta writes the popular blog zen habits.

To me it read like a calmer version of [Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280). A lot of the same ideas are included, but in a less pragmatic and more holistic way. I do wonder what the relationship is between Babauta and Getting Things Done. It wouldn't surprise me if that was where he started his journey.

I particularly liked his angle on nutrition, exercise and forming habits. It's a powerful idea to start forming habits with activities that are so simple it's almost funny. For instance, exercise 5 minutes per day for a week, then add 5 minutes each week until a month has passed. You should have a habit by then, even though you're just getting to 20 minutes of exercise per day. I like it.

### Notes

(I read this on Kindle and marked way more notes than I realized.)

Principle 1: By setting limitations, we must choose the essential. So in everything you do, learn to set limitations.
Principle 2: By choosing the essential, we create great impact with the minimal resources. Always choose the essential to maximize your time and energy.

Find tasks with most impact:

1. Examine your task list. Take a look at everything on your list and ask yourself the following questions about each one: Will this have an impact that will last beyond this week or this month? How will it change my job, my career, my life? How will this further a long-term goal of mine? How important is that goal?
2. Start with your goals. If you start by identifying the things you really want to accomplish in the next year, you can plan your tasks so that you are doing things each day to further those goals along. Let's say you have three long-term goals -- each day, choose a task from your list that will move you closer to those goals. This will ensure that you are completing the tasks with the most impact, because they relate directly to a long-term goal.

Apply limitations: Have too many emails in your inbox? Apply a limitation: You'll only check email twice a day and only respond to five emails each time. You'll be forced to work more effectively and only write important emails.

Some questions to help you limit yourself: Which areas of my life are overwhelming? What would I like to simplify? In addition to the tasks I need to accomplish in different areas, do I want to limit the number of possessions I have, what information I receive, or what responsibilities I have?

Being limitless is weak. Learn to focus yourself with limits and you'll increase your strength.

Choosing the essential: 
* What are your values? Values are simply knowing what things are most important to you. 
* What are your goals? What do you want to achieve in life? How about over the next year/month/today? 
* What has the biggest impact? If you have a choice to make between a list of projects or tasks, think about which project or task will make the biggest difference in your life or career.
* Eliminate the nonessential. Sometimes it's useful to work backward, if you're having trouble figuring out the essentials.
* The key is to take a few moments (or hours or days) to stop what you are doing and think about it in a broader perspective. Are you focusin gon the essentials? What are the essentials? Can you eliminate the nonessentials?

Clutter: Eliminate clutter by starting with the needs vs. wants question, by eliminating the nonessential and using the continual editing process.

Regular review: Choosing the essential is almost never a one-time decision.

Focus: If you can maintain your focus on a goal or habit, you willmore often than not achieve that goal or create that habit.

Single tasking examples:
* First thing in the morning, work on your Most Important Task. Don't do anything else until this is done. Give yourself a short break, then start on your next Most Important Task. If you can get two to three of these done in the morning, the rest of the day is gravy.
* When you are working on a task in a time block, turn off all other distractions. Shut off email and the entire Internet if possible.
* If you feel the urge to check your email or switch to another task, stop yourself. Breathe deeply. Refocus yourself.
* If other things come in while you're working, put them in your inbox or take a note of them in a small notebook. Get back to the task at hand.
* Take deep breaths, stretch, and take breaks now and then. Enjoy life. Go outside and appreciate nature. Keep yourself sane.

Focus on being present:
* When you eat, just eat. The best way to think about being present is this: do just one thing at a time.
* Be aware. Another important step is to become more aware of your thoughts.
* Exercise. Exercise is [his] meditation. [He] runs and only runs. [He] focuses on [his] running, on [his] breathing, on [his] body, on nothing but the present. It's great practice.

Create new habits with a 30-day challenge:
* [I'm trying this](http://bjhess.com/blog/30_days_of_exercise/).
* Select one habit for the challenge. Only one habit per month. You can choose any habit -- whatever you think will have the biggest impact on your life.
* Write down your plan.
* Post your goal publicly. Tell as many people as possible that you are trying to form your new habit. Suggest an online forum.
* Report on your progress daily.
* Celebrate your new habit! After thirty days, you will have a new habit. You will still need to make sure you do the habit each day, but it'll be fairly well entrenched if you were consistent all month.

Why the 30-day challenge works:
* Commitment. Just the act of committing to the Challenge, and setting a measurable goal, and declaring it to a bunch of others, is a huge step toward making the habit change a success.
* Accountability. The daily check-in makes you want to do your daily habit.
* Encouragement. There is also value in reporting your struggles.
* Inspiration. When you see everyone else doing so great, it's inspiring. If they can do it, so can you!

Rule for the 30-day challenge:
* Do only one habit at a time.
* Choose an easy goal. If you think you can exercise for thirty minutes a day, choose ten. If you want to wake up at 5am every day, start by waking up just 15 minutes earlier. Start a diet by making one healthy change to your diet, not a major overhaul. Making it super easy is one of the best ways to ensure you'll succeed.
* Choose something measurable.
* Be consistent. You want to do your habit change at the same time every day if possible.
* Report daily.
* Keep positive.

Example habits to try:
* Set your 3 Most Important Tasks each morning.
* Check email just twice a day.
* Exercise five to ten minutes a day.
* Work while disconnected, with no distractions.
* Eat more fruits and veggies every day.
* Say no to commitments and requests that aren't on your short list.
* Declutter your house for fifteen minutes a day

Starting small seems like a powerful tool to me. From the book: Gradual change is longer lasting. Think of dieting -- when you go on a sever, drastic diet and you lose forty pounds in two months, it feels pretty great, but more often than not those forty pounds will come back and then some. But if you do small changes -- perhaps one to two pounds a week -- those pounds are much more likely to stay off. This has been proven repeatedly in weight loss studies and it works with any kind of change. Make gradual changes, in a series of small steps over time, and you're more likely to stick to those changes than if you attempt a big change all at once.

Simpler than GTD project management:
* List three most important projects on your Simple Project List. Everything else goes on a second, On Deck List.
* Don't move any project from On Deck to the Simple Project List until _all_ three projects are done on the Simple Project List.

Making daily Most Important Tasks (MIT) work:
* Set them first thing in the morning (or the evening before).
* Limit yourself to three.
* Ensure that one MIT is goal-related or related to one of your top three projects.
* Focus on accomplishing these tasks above all others.
* Do your MITs early in the day before you do anything else.

Common productivity tip: Don't check email first thing in the morning. Checking email in the morning allows email to dictate the rest of your day instead of deciding for yourself what your MIT will be for the day.

Batch work. Any repetitive daily emails that require short work? Filter them to a "batch" folder and process them all at once one time per day.

His early morning experience: I've made it a habit to wake before most others, at about 4:30am and just enjoy the quiet and solitude. It has made all the difference in the world. I sit quietly with a cup of coffee, and enjoy the silence. I go for a morning run, which relieves stress and is perfect for contemplation. I recommend creating your own calming routine. Give it a couple weeks to become a habit, focus on doing it every day, and soon you will not want to miss it.

His decluttered experience: One of the things that gives me the most peace in my life is having a clean, simple home. When I wake in the morning and walk out into a living room that has been decluttered, that has a minimalist look, and where there isn't junk lying around, I start my day with calm and joy.

I've heard this before, but thirty-day list: This is a really good way to control the desires to buy stuff. Make a list. Anytime you want to buy something other than necessities, put it on the list with the date you added it. Then, don't allow yourself to buy the item until it's been on the list for thirty days.

Simple meditation technique: Sit somewhere comfortable, early in the morning, and close your eyes. Then focus your attention on your breathing. If your attention wanders, simply become aware of it, acknowledge the thoughts that come into  your head, and return your attention to your breathing. Feel your breath as it comes into your body, and then as it exits. Keep your attention on your breathing for as long as possible. It takes practice, but you'll get better at it.

Slow eating: A growing number of studies confirm that just by eating more slowly, you'll consume fewer calories -- in fact, enough to lose twenty pounds a year without doing anything different or eating anything different. (_ed: I'm not sure I believe this!_) The reason is that it takes about twenty minutes for our brains to register that we're full.

Simple fitness plan:
* Use the first month to focus exclusively on forming the exercise habit. (With easy workouts.)
* The second month, while continuing the exercise habit, focus on making gradual, healthy change to your diet.
* Every month thereafter, set short-term goals for gradual improvements in exercise and diet. Reward yourself each month for your progress and stay accountable to outhers for your fitness plan.

Forming an exercise habit:
* Start light.
* Schedule your workout time.
* Don't allow yourself to miss a day.
* Don't give up (!)
* Get a partner if you can.
* Be accountable to others
* Enjoy yourself.

Diet tips:
* Eat when you're lightly hungry. Not when you're ravenous. This means eating every 3-4 hours and paying more attention to your hunger.
* Eat light foods. Lots of fruits and veggies, whole grains, beans and nuts.
* Eat slowly.
* Eat until lightly full.
